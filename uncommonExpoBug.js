This error typically occurs when you're using an older version of Expo CLI or have conflicting dependencies in your project.  It might manifest as an unexpected behavior during the build process, or the build process might fail altogether.  Sometimes the error message itself isn't very descriptive, making it hard to pinpoint the exact cause.  For example, you might see a general error message about a build failure without specifics.
