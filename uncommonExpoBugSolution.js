The solution often involves updating Expo CLI to the latest version and meticulously checking for conflicting dependencies in your `package.json`.  This might mean using `expo upgrade` to update your Expo and React Native versions. Carefully review the versions of all packages to ensure compatibility.  If you're still experiencing problems, check the Expo documentation for known issues and solutions.  If those steps fail, the following strategies can help:

1. **Clean the project:** Delete the `node_modules` folder and reinstall the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. **Enable verbose logging:** Add `--verbose` to your Expo CLI build command to get more detailed logs. This can provide valuable clues about the cause of the error. 
3. **Simplify your project:** If possible, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem.
4. **Examine the logs:** Carefully analyze the complete log output.  Even seemingly insignificant details can provide hints.
5. **Check for dependency conflicts:** Resolve conflicting package versions and ensure you are on a supported and compatible version of React Native.
